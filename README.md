# Climate-and-Economic-Justice-Project
ClimateEconJustice reads a CSV into a 3-level linked list: states link to counties, counties link to communities, and each community stores climate and demographic Data. It then traverses the structure to run queries like disadvantaged counts by race threshold, states with PM above a level, flood-risk counts, and lowest-income communities per state
